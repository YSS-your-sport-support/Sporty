<h1>🎾 Sporty </h1>
<p> an adaptive sports app that tailors the entire experience to each user’s interests.
Through a simple quiz, it builds a customized profile that reflects the user’s chosen sport with unique content and visuals.</p>

<h3>Project Idea:-</h3>
<p>After a quick quiz, Sporty builds a personalized profile that adapts its colors, content, and experience to the user’s chosen sport — from swimming to gymnastics and beyond.
Each sport comes with its own world of training tips, skill levels, movement guides, exclusive gear, first-aid info, donation opportunities, and local events. Through its vibrant community, Sporty brings athletes together to learn, grow, and stay inspired — all in one interactive space designed around their passion.</p>
